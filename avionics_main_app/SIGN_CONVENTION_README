e = set - meas (CORRECT CONVENTION)

Worked example:

set meas e

0 10 -10
0 9  -9
0 8  -8
0 7  -7

If derivative on MEASUREMENT: Derivative term MUST be of form -1.0f * k_D * dMeasurement/dT
If derivative on ERROR: Derivative term MUST be of form k_D * dMeasurement/dT

k_D SHALL always be a positive floating-point number!!!!
