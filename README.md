# QuadcopterCodebase

This repository holds flight software, test workspaces, build and firmware load/debug tools and ongoing telemetry/proxying and visualization software for a Quadcopter UAV system that uses an STM32F3 
Discovery Development Board as its primary flight computer. The reference compiler and toolchain used to build and load/debug the flight firmware is in the "toolchains" directory in this repo. The 
"flight_software" directory holds all libraries and HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) firmware required to support the primary flight and testbed applications (located in avionics_main_app and testbed_app 
respectively)
