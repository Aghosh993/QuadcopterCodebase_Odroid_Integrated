# README

This is a testing "sandbox" build environment that pulls from the same 
flight software libraries as the "avionics_main_app" directory which 
contains the actual mission-critical flight main application. Test new 
stuff, sensor interfaces and anything else considered "experimental" 
over here, and when the time comes write a new library and add new 
functionality to the main app in the avionics main app workspace.
